ðŸ§© Exercise: Social Network Friend Recommendations - Part 1
==========================================================

You're building a social network feature that recommends friends based on mutual connections.
This exercise focuses on implementing a graph data structure and basic traversal algorithms.

Given a social network represented as a graph where:
- Each person is a node (vertex)
- Each friendship is an edge
- We want to find people who are "friends of friends" (2 degrees of separation)

Your task is to implement a FriendGraph class with methods to:
1. Add friendships between people
2. Find all friends of a given person
3. Find all friends-of-friends (excluding direct friends)

Example:
Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie
Bob is friends with David and Eve
Charlie is friends with Frank

Alice's friends: [Bob, Charlie]
Alice's friends-of-friends: [David, Eve, Frank] (excluding Bob and Charlie)

Class: FriendGraph
Methods:
- add_friendship(person1: str, person2: str) -> None
- get_friends(person: str) -> List[str]
- get_friends_of_friends(person: str) -> List[str]
